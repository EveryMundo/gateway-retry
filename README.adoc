== Spring Cloud Gateway Retry filter POC

=== Versions

* Spring Boot 2.1.6.RELEASE
* Spring Cloud Greenwich.SR2


=== Steps to reproduce the error

* Run the Eureka service, it will listen on port 8761. 
* Run the Greeting service, it will listen on port 9090. It will purposely fail 50% of the requests. 
* Run the Gateway service, it will listen on port 8080.
* Run the client application.
** It will perform 20 GET requests to the endpoint http://localhost:8080/greeting-service/hello - The  Retry filter will ensure all of them are successful. 
** It will perform 20 POST requests with a JSON payload to the endpoint http://localhost:8080/greeting-service/hello - The Retry filter doesn't guarantee the successful execution when the underlying service fails.
